3: pin 12 is not 5v tolerent and has the following functions
AN4: analog input 
C1IN: comparator input 
CN6: change notification input
RB4: digital input/output

4: you would modify the TRISC register to change the direction of the pin.

5: 0x000000C3

6: SYSCLK is the clock signal that powers the cpu, ram and other features of the chip
that require high speeds

PBCLK is the clock signal that powers the peripherals of the chip, it is lower speed
and runs analog io, pwm, I2C, SPI and other peripherals

PORTA to PORTG are digital io pins 

Timer1 to Timer5 are 16 bit counters that can be used for timing and counting internal or 
external events. 

10-bit ADC is a 10 bit analog to digital converter that can be used to 
read analog signals between 0 and 3.3v with 10 bit resolution.

PWM OC1-5: 5 PWM outputs that can be used to generate a square wave signal 
with a variable duty cycle

Data RAM is where temporary data is stored while the program is running, such as variables

Program flash memory is where the program is stored
 
prefetch catch modual is a small memory that stores the next instructions
to be executed so the cpu is not limited by the speed of the program memory

7: PORTA-G, USB CAN1-2, Ethernet, DMAC, ICD

8: 3.3 / 2^10 = 0.00322v = 3.22mv

9: 16 catch lanes * 16 bytes per lane = 256 bytes

10: 128 bits of cache allows the prefetch modual to fetch instructions fast enough 
to keep the cpu busy, any less the cpu would have to wait for instructions from the 
program memory and more is unnecessary. 

11: a digital io pin can be switched into open collector mode and then 
the pin can be pulled high by a resistor to 4v

12: 
Flash is from 0x1D000000 to 0x1F800000, max flash = 0x02800000 bytes
Ram is from 0x00000000 to 0x1D000000, max ram = 0x1D000000 bytes

13: in DEVCFG1: DEVICE CONFIGURATION WORD 1
    FPBDIV (bits 12,13) set to 01 sets PBCLK to is SYSCLK / 2

    FWDTEN (bit 23) set to 1 ennables the watchdog timer
    WDTPS<4:0> bits 20-16 are watchdog timer postscale select bits
    10100 = 1:1048576, max time interval

    bit 2-0: oscillator selection bits 
    set to 011 = primary oscillator (XT, HS, EC) with PLL
    

14: 5v regulator provides up to 1A of current V=ir so 5v/1A = 5 ohms

15: 3.3v - 9v, min is 3.3v because this is what the chip requires to run and the 
regulator can't increase the voltage, max is 9v because the regulator will overheat at higher
voltages

16: leds connected from 3.3v to RF0 (pin 58) and RF1 (pin 59) and will be on when the pins are low
buttons connected to GND on one side and RD7 (pin 55) and MCLR (pin 7) on the other side with a pull up resistor to 
3.3v on the pins.
