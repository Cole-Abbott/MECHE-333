7: the .o file contains extra functions from librarys used in the program. 
   before converting to the hex file the extra unsed functions are removed.

1: the functions NU32DIP_Startup, NU32DIP_ReadUART1, NU32DIP_WriteUART1 and
the constants NU32DIP_DESIRED_BAUD, NU32DIP_GREEN, NU32DIP_YELLOW, NU32DIP_USER, NU32DIP_SYS_FREQ
are public

2: a) see invest.c

   b) see mainB.c, helper.c, helper.h
        in main.c: main function, includes helper.h, nu32dip.h
        in helper.c: helper functions, includes helper.h, nu32dip.h, stdio.h
        in helper.h: function prototypes for getUserInput, calculateGrowth, and sendOutput
            definition of struct investment
        helper.h contains prototypes of functions used in main.c and 
        defintions of structs used in main.c and helper.c

   c) see mainC.c, invest.h, io.c, io.h, calculate.c, calculate.h
        main.c: main routine, includes io.h, calculate.h
        io.c, io.h: contains functions for input and output, includes invest.h
        calculate.c, calculate.h: contains functions for calculating growth, includes invest.h
        invest.h: contains investment struct used in all files,
            this is needed because io.c and calculate.c need to know the definition of the struct
            but it can't be defined in io.c and calculate.c because then it will have multiple definitions
