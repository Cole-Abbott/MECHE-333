1. See Hello.c
2. a pointer is a variable that stores the address of another variable, 
a non-pointer variable is a variable that stores a value
3. Interpreted code is code that is executed by an interpreter that runs in real 
time to convert the code into instructions that the computer can understand (machine code).
Compiled code is code that is converted into machine code by a compiler before 
it is executed.

4. a) 0x1E: 00011110, 030
   b) 0x32: 00110010, 050
   c) 0xFE: 11111110, 254
   d) 0xC4: 11000100, 196

6. 2^16 addresses * 8 bits per address = 524288 bits

7. a) 107 b) 53 c) 61 d) 63

8. unsigned char has a range of 0 to 255, short has range of -32768 to 32767, 
double has range of -1.7e308 to 1.7e308\

10. a signed int can represent negative numbers since the first bit is used to denote
the sign. unsigned ints can not represent negative numbers but can represent larger 
numbers since the first bit is not used to denote the sign.

11. a) A char only uses 1 byte of memory, while an int uses 4 bytes of memory.
this means that using chars for integer math can be faster and use less memory than
using ints, but it can also cause problems if the number is too large to fit in a char.
ie, greater than 255.
b) for floating point math, floats use 4 bytes of memory, while doubles use 8 bytes, 
so floats will use less memory while doubles will be more accurate.
c) for integer math, chars will store integers exaxtly, and float will not, and will
introduce rounding errors, but can represent a larger range of values

16. A pointer is most similar to a long int since it occupies 8 bytes of memory, and stores
an exact integer value.
